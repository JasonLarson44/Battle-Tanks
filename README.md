# Battle-Tanks
Simple Node.js game using express and canvas

Server starts on port 5000 by default.

***NOTE***

If you would like to let people from outside your network play, you will have to forward port 5000 to your machine's IP. 

To play, clone the repo and navigate to the project directory. Run npm init. Run npm start. The server will start up on port 5000. Have your friends connect
to $your-ip$:5000 to play.
